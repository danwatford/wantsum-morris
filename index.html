    <h1>Wantsum Morris Men</h1>

    <p>Wantsum Morris Men formed as a club in 1967, with the members living both sides of the Wantsum Channel, which in
        former times separated Thanet from the rest of Kent. The repertoire is drawn from the vast selection of
        traditional dances collected from the villages of the Cotswolds, complemented by some more recent dances in the
        Cotswold traditions as well as a few from the Welsh borders and a rapper dance from the North East of
        England.</p>

    <p>The costume is knee breeches, tabard and a tricorn hat. The tabard is decorated with a St Augustines cross with
        a depiction of Reculver towers in the top left corner. St Augustine arrived in England at the Southern end of
        the Wantsum, and built an Abbey at Reculver at the Northern end.</p>

    <p>Among other events Wantsum Morris Men perform annual tours on <a href="/boxing-day">Boxing Day</a>, May 1st,
        <a href="/hop-hoodening">Hop Hoodening in September</a>,
        and <a href="http://broadstairsfolkweek.org.uk/" target="_blank">Broadstairs Folk Week in August</a>.
        We have occasionally ventured onto foreign soils with trips including the Tarn
        valley in France, The Eastern seaboard of the U.S.A. and Poland.</p>
