    <p>The term ‘hoodening’ refers to an ancient East Kent tradition, usually performed around Christmas, whereby local
        farm workers dressed as various characters accompanied a ‘Hooden Horse’ which consisted of a man bent double to
        resemble a horse, covered by a black cape and holding a wooden horse's head on a pole. The horses jaw was hinged
        to make a clapping sound and help create its character. They would tour the local big houses and perform a play
        in return for refreshments or money. The tradition more or less died out between the wars but was started up
        again in the 1950s and 60s. Hop Hoodening made use of the term because of its Kentish origins and to denote the
        celebratory theme of the day.</p>

    <p>The earliest record anywhere of a rural Morris tour is found in the Canterbury Cathedral Library. In 1589 a team
        from Herne danced in Reculver, Hothe, Bridge and in Canterbury itself, where they were then summoned to appear
        before the Mayor for performing without a licence.</p>
