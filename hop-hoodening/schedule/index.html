<p>This year the celebrations will begin at 10.50am with a procession within the Cathedral precincts and into the
    Cathedral. The procession will be led by the Hop Queen in her hop bower accompanied by her Princesses. At 11am
    there will be a service in the Cathedral Nave attended by the Lord Mayor of Canterbury. During the service the
    Blessing of the Hops will be conducted and this year Rabble, our guests from Lenham, will dance. Following this
    at 11.45 there will be a display of dancing by all the attendant sides in the precincts.</p>


<p>From 12.15pm the various Morris sides may be seen dancing around the city while the Hop Queen and her Princesses
    distribute blessed hops to the good people of Canterbury. They then meet up at Best Lane at 2.45 to process up
    the High Street to Rose Square for a final mass display of dancing. Everyone is welcome to attend the Cathedral
    service and to enjoy the skilful presentations of dancing around the city.</p>
