  Wantsum Morris Men formed as a club in 1967, with the members living both sides of the Wantsum Channel,
  which in former times separated Thanet from the rest of Kent. The repertoire is drawn from the vast selection
  of traditional dances collected from the villages of the Cotswolds, complemented by some more recent dances in
   the Cotswold traditions as well as a few from the Welsh borders and a rapper dance from the North East of England.
