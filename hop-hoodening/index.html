<p>Hop Hoodening, Canterbury's celebration of the hop harvest, will take place on Saturday 14th September 2019.
        Kent’s original hop festival began in 1957 and has taken place in Canterbury and the surrounding area on the
        second Saturday in September each year, making this the 67th annual Hop Hoodening. Organised by the Wantsum
        Morris Men this colourful and lively event is closely linked to Canterbury Cathedral where the hops are
        ceremonially blessed.</p>

    <p>The term ‘hoodening’ refers to an ancient East Kent tradition, usually performed around Christmas, whereby local
        farm workers dressed as various characters accompanied a ‘Hooden Horse’ which consisted of a man bent double to
        resemble a horse, covered by a black cape and holding a wooden horse's head on a pole. The horses jaw was hinged
        to make a clapping sound and help create its character. They would tour the local big houses and perform a play
        in return for refreshments or money. The tradition more or less died out between the wars but was started up
        again in the 1950s and 60s. Hop Hoodening made use of the term because of its Kentish origins and to denote the
        celebratory theme of the day.</p>

    <p>The earliest record anywhere of a rural Morris tour is found in the Canterbury Cathedral Library. In 1589 a team
        from Herne danced in Reculver, Hothe, Bridge and in Canterbury itself, where they were then summoned to appear
        before the Mayor for performing without a licence.</p>

    <p>Check back here regularly for confirmation of the day's proceedings.</p>

    <p>This year the celebrations will begin at 10.50am with a procession within the Cathedral precincts and into the
        Cathedral. The procession will be led by the Hop Queen in her hop bower accompanied by her Princesses. At 11am
        there will be a service in the Cathedral Nave attended by the Lord Mayor of Canterbury. During the service the
        Blessing of the Hops will be conducted and this year Rabble, our guests from Lenham, will dance. Following this at 11.45 there will be a display of dancing by all
        the attendant sides in the precincts: Wantsum Morris Men’s guests for the day include Offcumduns, Dead Horse
        Morris, Broom dashers, Long Man Morris Men, Oyster Morris, Ravensbourne Morris Men, Loose Women,
        Kettle Bridge Clog, Hedcorn Morris and Rabble.</p>
