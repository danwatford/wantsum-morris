<p>Kentâ€™s original hop festival began in 1957 and has taken place in Canterbury
    and the surrounding area on the second Saturday in September each year,
    making this the 63rd annual Hop Hoodening. Organised by the Wantsum
    Morris Men this colourful and lively event is closely linked to <a
            href="https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/whats-on/event/hop-hoodening-4/" target="_blank">Canterbury
        Cathedral</a> where
    the hops are ceremonially blessed in the presence of the <a

            target="_blank">Lord Mayor of Canterbury</a>. Everyone is invited to attend this free event both in the
    Cathedral and then around the city centre (voluntary collection taken to
    support it's running costs).</p>
